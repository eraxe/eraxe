## About This Guy

I mostly work on backend systems, scripts, and turning rough ideas into something real and useful. I’m into automation — especially when it saves time on repetitive tasks across dev, deployment, or day-to-day operations.

I’ve worked with Django, REST APIs, shell scripting, and modular codebases, but I’m not married to any tool. If something better fits the task, I’ll pick it up and run with it. Tools change — solving the problem is what matters.

I’ve deployed projects using both Nginx and LiteSpeed Enterprise, usually with an eye on performance and keeping things light on the hardware. Security and reliability are always top of mind, especially when dealing with DDoS protection and locking down exposed surfaces.

I've also worked with WordPress and WooCommerce when it made sense for the job. Wherever possible, I try to keep systems simple — not sloppy, just lean — without skipping the important stuff. And even though I’m mostly on the backend, I still care about how things look and feel. A clean UI, smooth UX, and the occasional visual flair can go a long way.

I tend to work a bit off-script — not everything I write starts with a perfect plan. But in the mess, there’s often something unexpected that works better than the “by-the-book” approach. That flexibility has been surprisingly useful.

I’m comfortable working with a team, managing a small one, or just quietly scripting behind the scenes to keep things running smoother.
