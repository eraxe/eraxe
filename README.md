## 👋 About This One...

I mostly work on backend systems, scripts, and turning messy ideas into real, working tools.  
Automation? Love it. Repetitive tasks? Not if I can help it.  
Sometimes I build things the “wrong” way — and they end up working better that way.

## 🛠️ What I work with

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, PHP, Shell
- **Frameworks**: Django, Angular, REST APIs
- **Dev Tools**: VS Code, IntelliJ, tmux, Git
- **Infra**: Linux, Nginx, LiteSpeed Enterprise, WordPress, WooCommerce

## ⚙️ What I care about

- Keeping systems lean, fast, and secure  
- Modular code that’s actually readable  
- UI/UX that feels good (yes, backend people can care too)  
- Small tools that solve real problems  
- Automation that gives me time back  
- Clean code? Sometimes. Clean solutions? Always.

<summary>💬 Random facts</summary>

- Not the most organized coder — and that’s part of the magic  
- I like eye candy in terminal themes and websites alike  
- Half my commits probably started with “wait... what if I just”  
- Most fun: taking weird ideas and making them work
